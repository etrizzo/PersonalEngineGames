About Asteroids
---------------

Asteroids was the first project I created in my personal engine, and my first real project using C++. In the context of my coursework at guildhall, it served as a great way to explore new technologies and carve out the basic framework of my engine in a few short weeks. But my biggest takeaway for asteroids is the importance of juice, and a passion for the work that you're doing.

During the time that we were developing asteroids in-class, I enjoyed exploring ways to make the game feel unique even though we were limited to untextured lines for drawing. Even though it's a simple game to implement, I had so much fun creating asteroids that I chose to go back and continue polishing it much later, with some of the new features I had added to my engine.
