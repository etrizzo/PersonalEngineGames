<Act name="Arrest" number="3" />

<!--
	Might need to be a universal act that spans all data sets.
	- Kind of weird because we want to support multiple endings, so we shouldn't require any concrete ending tags(i.e. "the killer was arrested" vs. "the killer escapes")
	- unless there's just multiple conclusion acts, but that breaks the "linear & ordered" rule
<Act name="Conclusion" number="4" />
